# PSVerGUI
PSVerGUI is a Post Silicon Verification test suite.
It has a requirements.txt file to enable virtual environment setup and a .spec file to enable compilation using the pyinstaller package.

This project gave me an opportunity to explore an intriguing GUI package that I found called PySimpleGUI. Having worked with QT in the past, I was looking for something which traded off some of the feature richness of QT or TKinter for simplicity. Ultimately, I really enjoyed working with the package and only felt limited by a lack of features a few times.
